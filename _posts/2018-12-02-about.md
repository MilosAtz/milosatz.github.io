Thanks for visiting my personal website! I am a postdoctoral appointee in the Nuclear Science and Engineering Division at Argonne National Laboratory. This website hosts information about my research and personal adventures. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions for me or are interested in my research or potential collaboration.


**My name**

My name is Milos: formally, it's spelled Milo≈°, phonetically, it's "mil-ish" ("like 'mil', but only kind of"). 

**Research**

Currently, I am developing and updating the thermal hydraulics analysis software used at Argonne National Laboratory in support of the Versatile Test Reactor core design. For my PhD, I performed analysis of nuclear waste characteristics, management strategies, and disposal performance for different nuclear energy fuel cycles. Previously, my research was on criticality safety assessments for geological repositories.

**Education**

* University of California, Berkeley: PhD, Nuclear Engineering (2016 - 2019)
* University of California, Berkeley: MS, Nuclear Engineering (2014 - 2016)
* University of Connecticut: BS, Chemical Engineering (2010 - 2014)

**Personal**

In my free time you may find me eating, skiing, hiking, and travel (see the "Adventures" page). I also enjoy weightlifting; my current powerlifting personal bests are 425 lb. squat, 300 lb. bench press, and 525 lb. deadlift. I've also volunteered for a week during the summers of 2017 and 2018 as a counselor at the [Painted Turtle Camp](http://thepaintedturtle.org) in Lake Hughes, CA. Hopefully more on those things here soon.
