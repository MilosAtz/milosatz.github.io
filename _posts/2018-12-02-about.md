Thanks for visiting my personal website! I am pursuing my PhD in nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. This website hosts information about my research and personal adventures. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions for me or are interested in my research or potential collaboration.


**My name**

My name is Milos: formally, it's spelled Milo≈°, phonetically, it's "mil-ish" ("like 'mil', but only kind of"). 

**Research**

At the moment, I am working on analysis of nuclear waste characteristics, management strategies, and disposal performance for different nuclear energy fuel cycles. Previously, my research was on criticality safety assessments for geological repositories.

**Education**

* University of California, Berkeley: PhD, Nuclear Engineering (2016 - present)
* University of California, Berkeley: MS, Nuclear Engineering (2014 - 2016)
* University of Connecticut: BS, Chemical Engineering (2010 - 2014)

**Personal**

In my free time you may find me eating, skiing, hiking, and travel (see the "Adventures" page). I also enjoy weightlifting; my current powerlifting personal bests are 425 lb. squat, 300 lb. bench press, and 525 lb. deadlift. Hopefully more on those things here soon.
