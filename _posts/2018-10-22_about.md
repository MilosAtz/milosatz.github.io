My name is Milo≈° (pronunciation hint: like "mil", but only kind of). I am currently a pursuing my PhD in nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I earned my MS at Berkeley in nuclear engineering in 2016 and graduated with my BS in chemical engineering from the University of Connecticut in 2014.

This website aims to consolidate my research and personal adventures. At the moment, I am working on analysis of nuclear waste characteristics, management strategies, and disposal performance for different nuclear energy fuel cycles. In my free time, I enjoy eating, exercise, skiing, hiking, and travel.
