I love to travel and experience new places, foods, and people. I also love the outdoors, especially climbing up or skiing down mountains.

# 2018

**Redwood National and State Parks (November 2018)**

Spent a rainy Thanksgiving weekend camping at Redwood National and State Parks in Northern CA. We arrived on Thursday evening and had pre-prepared our Thanksgiving dinner so we could heat it on the camp stove under the canopy. Because Friday was rainy, there were very few people out even on the main park footpaths so we had the main attractions to ourselves. On Saturday, the sun came out so we did a more ambitious hike, a 10 mile loop through Elk Prarie Redwoods State Park.

**Eagle Lake, CA (November 2018)**

We drove up to Lake Tahoe for a night and day to escape the smokey air in the Bay Area. While we were there we took a little walk up to and around Eagle Lake.

**Yosemite National Park (October 2018)**

I camped for two nights near Yosemite National Park in order to hike Cloud's Rest. The weather was perfect - cold in the morning but sunny and mild during the day. The hike wasn't too strenuous but the altitude definitely affected me.

**United Kingdom (September-October 2018)**

I traveled to Manchester, UK for the 15th International Exchange Meeting on Partitioning and Transmutation. I presented a poster, titled "Impact of partitioning and transmutation on the back end of the fuel cycle". After the conference, I met up with some good friends to travel around the UK, since I'd never been outside of London. We spent a night in the Peak District and hiked Stannedge Edge, visited Bristol for a night out, then returned to London. There I met up with Carolyn for a whirlwind weekend before heading home.
