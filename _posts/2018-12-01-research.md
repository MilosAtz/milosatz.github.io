I am interested in the management of radioactive wastes from nuclear energy utilization, as well as the deployment of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, radiochemical separations, and the development of innovative technologies for nuclear energy.

Currently, I am developing analysis tools to study nuclear waste characteristics, management strategies, and disposal performance for different nuclear energy fuel cycles. These tools are contained in a Python package, called `nwpy` (for "Nuclear Waste in Python"). The data that underlies the package comes from the DOE [Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening report](https://fuelcycleevaluation.inl.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx) (2014). The code is not yet public but will eventually be distributed through my GitHub.

Previously, my research was on criticality safety assessments for geological repositories.
